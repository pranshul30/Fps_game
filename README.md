# Fps_game

Overview
This project is a minimalist First-Person Shooter (FPS) prototype designed to showcase core gameplay mechanics suitable for mobile platforms. It was developed to demonstrate foundational skills in mobile game development, particularly for roles focusing on gameplay prototyping and iteration. The aim was to create a functional, tactile experience that could be rapidly iterated upon.

Features
This prototype focuses on the essential elements of an FPS game, built to be achievable within a few hours:

First-Person Perspective: Standard FPS camera and player view.

Mobile-Optimized Controls:

Left Touchpad: Virtual joystick for player movement (forward, backward, strafe).

Right Touch Area: Drag to look around and aim.

Fire Button: Simple tap to shoot.

Basic Player Movement: Walk, run (implied by joystick movement), and jump.

Core Weapon System:

Single primary weapon (e.g., a simple projectile or hitscan rifle).

Visual and audio feedback for firing (muzzle flash, sound).

Basic ammo count display.

Simple Enemy AI:

A single, basic AI enemy that can detect the player and fire back.

Basic health system for the enemy.

Compact Arena Map: A small, functional level designed for quick combat encounters and testing movement/shooting mechanics.

How to Play
Movement: Use the virtual joystick on the left side of the screen to move your character.

Look/Aim: Drag your finger across the right side of the screen to control your camera and aim.

Fire: Tap the dedicated "Fire" button to shoot your weapon.

Objective: Eliminate the enemy AI.

Technical Highlights
Engine: Unity3D

Language: C#

Mobile-First Design: Implemented with touch inputs in mind, prioritizing responsiveness and ease of use on small screens.

Rapid Prototyping: Emphasizes clean, modular code for quick iteration on gameplay mechanics.

Minimalist Assets: Utilizes Unity primitives and basic placeholder assets to focus entirely on gameplay systems.

Setup & Running the Project
Clone the Repository:

git clone [YOUR_REPOSITORY_URL_HERE]

Open in Unity:

Launch Unity Hub.

Click "Add" and navigate to the cloned project folder.

Open the project (Unity version used: [e.g., 2022.3.10f1 - Replace with your actual Unity version]).

Build for Mobile (Android/iOS):

Go to File > Build Settings...

Select your target platform (Android or iOS).

Ensure the SampleScene (or your main game scene) is included in "Scenes In Build."

Click "Build" or "Build And Run" to deploy to your device.

Future Enhancements (Roadmap)
Given more time, this prototype could be expanded with:

Additional weapons (shotgun, sniper rifle) with unique properties.

More complex AI behaviors (patrolling, taking cover, advanced pathfinding).

Health packs, ammo pickups, and other interactive level elements.

Aim Down Sights (ADS) mechanic.

Improved visual effects and sound design.

Basic UI for health, ammo, and game state.

Score tracking and simple game loops (e.g., wave-based survival).
